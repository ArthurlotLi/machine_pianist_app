Machine Pianist - Web Application
Natural MIDI Performance Augmentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the power of machine learning to humanize automatic piano 
performances to the benefit of both composer and audience. Established
under the conjecture that the key "humanizing" components lacking in
widely available online MIDI files are:

1. Variable velocity of notes when pressed
2. Subjective choice of pedal positions throughout pieces

Given an input MIDI file lacking such details, augment the file with
key velocities and pedal positions to produce a more human-sounding 
performance for any arbitrary piano piece. 

This repository hosts the web application component of the Machine
Pianist project, which will allow users to perform their own songs with
the machine pianist. 

With this application, the following features will be provided:

A. Users may upload MIDI files to be performed. 
B. Users may listen to the AI performance on the website.
C. Users may save the AI performance as a MIDI or mp3.

Performances should be saved and new MIDIs should be screened to ensure
they have not been seen before they are fed to the model.
